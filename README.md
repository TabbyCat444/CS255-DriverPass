# CS255-DriverPass

### Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
This client was Liam, the owner of DriverPass, and the desired system will provide training to learning drivers to help assist them with their driving skills and prepare them for their driving exams to help decrease the amount of drivers who have to retake the exam multiple times. Liam wanted a website to allow his customers to book/modify driving lesson appointments, take written practice tests, and easily track/view their progress and instructor feedback. This sytem needed to include all the packages offered by the company as well as appropriate scalability and modern security for user information. Additionally, it needed to be able to connect to the DMV's website to ensure that the information being taught to learners stays current.

### What did you do particularly well?
After reviewing the interview transcript with the company, and a bit of learning about system analysis and design I believe that I captured a comprehensive set of non-functional requirements and assumptions regarding the use of the system, which can be seen in the attached documentation.

### If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
In the system design document I would target the UML class diagram as a place for improvement. I would like to add both multiplicities and methods to the diagram to provide a better depiction of how the classes interact with and relate to one another. 

### How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
When designing a system, it is important to remember that the user's needs are often similar too the client's requirements for the system, after all that is essentially the point of the system. Not all user needs/wants can be implemented on the client's budget so it is important to prioritize them in tandem with the client's approval. One example of how I implemented the user's needs for driverpass was remembering that having a simple, accessible customer support ticket option on the site is a valuable option.

### How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
This is the first time I have had to focus specifically on system analysis and the diagrams were very helpful. Previously I have used a class diagram and psuedocode before in my software design process. I would like to learn more about the various UML diagrams, and other charts that are used to help depict system design information. In the future I feel like being able to read this type of documentation and create good ones will be essential to my career choice.
